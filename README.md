"Madarmentes" project

My first team project, made by bsamu, enikobuza, KacagoHollo, tgabriella. 

The visitor starts on the landing page, where is located a button and a bird animation. On the home page there is a nav bar, and the different sections. Navbar workes partly, the project main element is the made design by CSS and CSS flexbox.

We borrowed the bird-animation from here: "https://codepen.io/__akash__19/pen/QWKpyMm", and it has been edited by us.
